        <p>My journey on Event Driven Programming is going well right now. I learned so many things on this major course-subject. When I first heard of it I thought to myself that it would be hard, but thanks to our teachers: Ma'am Phoebe and Sir Cliff, they made it understandable to me because of their fun teaching mechanics. The first thing I learned on this subject was the basics of GitHub, on how to create an account and how to use it. The tips they gave us were also very helpful on my current journey in this subject. The second was how to operate VSCode, how to create files and link them, and also on how to push it to GitHub. Then the third was when we created our autobiography website in our Laboratory 4. Currently, we are doing our first fully functional and fully navigational website. I made this testimonial in accordance with our Laboratory 5 activity. I learned many things from Ma'am Phoebe and Sir Cliff, and I hope that I will continue to learn as my college journey continues. I also want to thank my circle of friends who are always there for each other.</p>
